# Graph Algorithms - Design and Analysis of Algorithms Project

This project was developed as part of the **CS-2009 Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Spring 2025)** course at **FAST-NUCES, Islamabad**.  
It implements and analyzes various **graph algorithms** with detailed performance evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets.

## 📚 Algorithms Implemented
- **Single Source Shortest Path**
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**
  - Prim’s Algorithm
  - Kruskal’s Algorithm
- **Graph Traversal**
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Other Graph Metrics**
  - Graph Diameter (Longest Shortest Path)
  - Cycle Detection
  - Average Degree Calculation

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Details
- **Language:** Python 3.9  
- **Libraries Used:** 
  - [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) (graph representation & manipulation)  
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (visualization & plotting)  
- **Dataset:** [roadNet-TX](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-TX.html) from Stanford SNAP  
  - ~1.37M nodes  
  - ~1.92M edges  
  - Undirected, sparse real-world road network  

Each algorithm saves:
- Results in `/results/`
- Execution traces in `/traces/`
- Visualizations in `/plots/`

Execution times were measured using Python’s `time` module for accuracy.

## 📊 Performance Analysis
Algorithms were tested on sampled subgraphs of **1000, 2000, 3000, and 5000 nodes**.  

- **Fastest:** Cycle Detection (~0.001s) & Average Degree (~0.015s)  
- **Moderate:** Dijkstra (~1.09s), Bellman-Ford (~0.034s)  
- **Heavy:** BFS, DFS, Diameter (>100s at 5000 nodes)  
- **MST Algorithms:** Prim’s (~99s) and Kruskal’s (~98s)  

Visual comparisons:
- **Bar Chart:** Execution times at 5000 nodes  
- **Line Graph:** Scaling performance across input sizes
